# LearnDeepLearningABitPerDay
Drop-Learning the Deep Learning. Each day learn 1 pomodoro whatever about DL: vision, techniques, coding, ...

### Day 1(20200201): Have Determination on learning DL.
To follow these sources:
 - DL powerful framework fastai from Jeremy Howard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfoYk_Z5AkI&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSIJb-Qd3pw0cqCbkGeS0xn
 - DL general view from Siraj Raval: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN9Lb3vXsAw
 - DL techniques from PyImageSearch: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/category/tutorials/
 
Expert goals:
 - Deep Learning
 - Reinforcement Learning
 - Cloud Service
 - Quantum Computing
 - Blockchain

### Day 2(20200202): Clear Goals of DL.
 - Image processing: computer vision + object detection
  - Neural Network models: DNN, CNN, DRNN, GAN, ResNET, Dense net, Siamese NET, ...
  - Optimization Algorithm: LP, DP, ILP, and all kind of heuristic searching algorithm
 - NLP: ?
 
### Day 3(20200203): DL Optimization.
 - LP: Logic Programs
